² The average excludes those reports in which the number of persons intercepted, the number of intercepts, or the number of incriminating intercepts was not reported or could not be determined.
³ Some wiretaps terminated in a given year are not reported until a subsequent year because they are part of ongoing investigations.",,,,,,,,,,,
